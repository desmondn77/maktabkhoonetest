we can define condition

public class condition {
    int scoreCondition;
    public void studentConditions(int scoreCondition){
        if (scoreCondition>80)
            System.out.println(scoreCondition + " is best condition");
        else if (scoreCondition>60)
            System.out.println( scoreCondition + " is good");
        else if (scoreCondition>40)
            System.out.println(scoreCondition + " is not bad");
        else
            System.out.println(scoreCondition + " is bad");
    }
}
